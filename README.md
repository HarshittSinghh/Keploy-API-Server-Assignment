## ðŸ“˜ Overview

**Bookly** is a full-stack Book Management application that enables users to perform CRUD operations on a collection of books. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, exposing custom RESTful APIs. The frontend is developed using React.js and styled with modern CSS to provide a responsive and intuitive user interface.

The application supports features like:
- Adding new books
- Viewing all books in a structured layout
- Deleting books
- Interactive UI with real-time updates

Itâ€™s a great demonstration of API development, database integration, and frontend-backend interaction in a clean, modular structure.
